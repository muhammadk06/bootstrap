                                    <p>CHERUB is a series of teenage spy novels written by English author Robert Muchamore, focusing around a fictional division of the British Security Service called CHERUB, which employs children, predominantly orphans, 17 or younger as intelligence agents.[1]

                                        Initially, the series follows James Choke, better known as James Adams (his adopted name at CHERUB), as he enters CHERUB and performs various missions. However, the focus later expands to other characters, such as James' sister Lauren and several other characters who work alongside him and in separate missions. The initial series of 12 novels runs from the recruitment of Adams aged 11 to his retirement from CHERUB at age 17. The second series of five novels, Aramov, follows Ryan Sharma, another CHERUB agent; James Adams reappears in this series as a CHERUB staff member.</p>
